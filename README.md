# Julia and Python environments

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Owieyy/metnum-julia/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2FPraktikum%252009.ipynb)

This example shows how you can install a Julia and Python environment side-by-side.
In this repository are *both* an `environment.yml` file as well as a `Project.toml` file.
The former corresponds to an anaconda python environment, and the latter corresponds
to a Julia environment. Both kernels will be available to you in a built Binder
environment.
